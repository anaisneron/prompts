Use GPT 5.3 Codex

Build me a comprehensive Python SEO and AI Search Optimization audit tool that crawls a given website URL (up to 50 pages deep) and generates a detailed HTML report. The tool should analyze three categories:
PART 1 — TECHNICAL SEO

Missing, duplicate or poorly optimized title tags
Missing or duplicate meta descriptions
H1/H2/H3 heading hierarchy issues
Broken internal links (404 errors)
Missing alt text on images
Page file sizes and performance indicators
Sitemap.xml presence and validity
Robots.txt analysis
Canonical tag implementation
Mobile viewport and responsive meta tags
HTTPS and mixed content issues
Internal linking structure and orphan pages

PART 2 — AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)

Schema markup presence and types (FAQ, HowTo, LocalBusiness, Organization, Product, Article, BreadcrumbList)
Schema markup validation and completeness
Content structured in question/answer format (natural FAQ patterns)
Featured snippet readiness: presence of concise definitions, numbered lists, comparison tables
Speakable content markup for voice search
Content clarity score: short paragraphs, direct answers within first 2 sentences
Entity identification: are key business entities (brand, products, services, people) clearly defined and consistent across pages
E-E-A-T signals: author attribution, about page, credentials, contact information, trust signals

PART 3 — GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

AI citability analysis: are key claims supported by data, statistics, or specific facts that AI models would cite
Source authority signals: outbound links to authoritative sources, references, studies
Content uniqueness indicators: presence of original data, unique perspectives, proprietary frameworks vs generic content
Topical authority mapping: does the site demonstrate depth on its core topics across multiple pages, or is coverage thin
Content freshness: last modified dates, publication dates, content recency signals
Conversational query readiness: does the content naturally answer "who, what, how, why, when" questions
Brand mention consistency: is the brand name, location, and value proposition stated clearly enough for AI models to associate and recommend
Multi-format content signals: presence of video embeds, infographics, downloadable resources that AI models reference

OUTPUT FORMAT
Generate a clean, professional HTML report with:

Executive summary with overall scores for each category (SEO, AEO, GEO) on a scale of 0-100
Color-coded severity levels: 🔴 Critical, 🟡 Warning, 🟢 Good
Each issue with: the specific page URL, what was found, why it matters, and the exact fix recommendation
A priority action plan: top 10 fixes ranked by impact
A "Share of Voice Readiness Score" that estimates how well the site is positioned to appear in AI-generated answers

Use libraries like requests, beautifulsoup4, and any other necessary packages. Make the tool reusable so I can run it on any URL.
